          <h2> Croissant filled with vanilla</h2>
          <h3>Price: $6.00</h3>
          <p>Homemade croissants is a rewarding process that begins with preparing a rich, buttery dough. Mix together flour, sugar, salt, and yeast, then add in warm milk and knead until a smooth dough forms. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle and spread softened butter over two-thirds of the surface. Fold the unbuttered third over the buttered portion, then fold the remaining third on top, creating layers. Chill the dough, then repeat the rolling and folding process multiple times to create flaky layers. After the final fold, chill the dough again before shaping it into crescents. Let the shaped croissants rise until doubled in size, then bake in a hot oven until beautifully golden and puffed. The result is a batch of irresistibly flaky and buttery croissants, perfect for breakfast or anytime indulgence.</p>
